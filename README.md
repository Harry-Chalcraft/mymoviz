# mymoviz
A simple movie plateform to check out the latest movies

Go **[here](https://gentle-headland-37730.herokuapp.com/)** for live demo.

This is a fun project to work on when learning ReactJS.

It only has 2 components App.js and it's child Movie.js, which requires being familiar with data flow and reverse data flow.

The movie cards and information are uploaded via themoviedb API, and the choices saved by the user are sent to a MongoDB.

The styling is primarly from [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) - an Open source toolkit for front-end component.
