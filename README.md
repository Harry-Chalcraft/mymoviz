# mymoviz
A simple movie plateform to check out the latest movies

Go **[here](https://harry-chalcraft-mymoviz.herokuapp.com/)** for live demo.

This is a fun project to work on when learning ReactJS.

It only has 2 components App.js and it's child Movie.js, which requires being familiar with data flow and reverse data flow.

The movie cards and information are uploaded via [themoviedb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) the descriptions are in french bur you can customize this in your request, and the choices saved by the user are sent to a MongoDB. The back-end is organised according to MVC.

The styling is primarly from [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) - an Open source toolkit for front-end component.
